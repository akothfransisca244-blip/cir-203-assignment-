EXERCISE 1  A)  import numpy as np
transactions=np.array({
{1200,1300,1250,1400,1500,1600}#branch A
{900,950,920,980,1000,1050}#branch B
{2000,2100,2050,2200,2300,2400}branch c
{500,550,600,650,700,750}branch d})

B)

Total transactions
total_per_branch=
transactions.sum(axis=1)
print("Total transactions per branch=",totals_per_branch)

C)Branch with the highest total transactions

idx_max=totals_per_branch.argmax()
branch_names={"branch A","branch B","branch c","branch d"}
highest_branch=branch_names{idx_max}
print{"Branch with the highest total:",highest_branch,"with",totals_per_branch{idx_max})

4)monthly_avg_across_branchess=
transactions.mean(axis=0)
overal_avg=transactions.mean()
print("Average per month across branchess(6 values):",
monthly_avg_across_branchess)
print("Overall average transaction volume(single number):",overall_avg)

5)
reshaped=transactions.reshape(3,8)
print("Reshaped(3*8):\n",reshaped)


reshaping does not reoder or aggregate data other than reinterpreting the linear sequence of elements.
reshaping is allowed becouse original size=4*6=24 elements, new shape 3*8 also=24
practically reshaping from 4*6 to 3*8 breaks the "branch* month" structure
